I'm renzo.

I am [@renzokott on Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username}}) and
[renzok on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}). And no, I do not have
a Facebook account, but you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/renzokottmann).


I was a comic and non-fiction books kid and as teen became a reader of
serious fiction from ranging from author's like Assimov and Arthur
C. Clarke in science fiction; William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouc and
others from the Beat Generation; french writers (sometimes called
existentialists) mostly Camus and Satre; and crime novels including
Eric Ambler, Jakob Arjouni, Andrea Camilleri, Raymond Chandler and
many others...

I am located in Bremen. Too small for a metropol and too large for a
city. I like to settle in the balance between extremes.

A good programmer is a good writer: http://blog.markpearl.co.za/Programming-subset-of-writing/

Therefore, I aim to write more than code and [scientific papers](http://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=en&user=uHcm-xEAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate)...
